## Gunshot Residue

An ammunition cartridge consists of a metal casing, smokeless propellant, one or more projectiles such as a bullet, and a primer citep{Walker_2013}.

Propellant consists predominantly of gls{NC} -- a low explosive -- as well as additives which help improve the combustion characteristics of the propellant and/or prevent degradation during storage.
Common additives include gls{DPA} (a stabiliser) and gls{EC} (a burning rate moderator).

During the firing process the primer is struck and detonates which, in turn, ignites the propellant.
Combustion of the propellant releases large volumes of gas -- up to 1,000 times the volume of the propellant -- which increase the pressure inside the cartridge case and propel the projectile down the barrel of the firearm citep{Walker_2013}.
The cartridge case is then ejected -- either manually, or mechanically for an automatic firearm -- and a new cartridge is loaded into the chamber.

In addition to the projectile and fired cartridge case, partially burned and unburned granules of propellant exit the firearm, along with solid and gaseous combustion products of the propellant.
Collectively, these make up \glsdisp{GSR}{\enquote{Gunshot Residue} (GSR)}.

## Previous Research

Several previous studies have been carried out to develop chemical and data analysis techniques for propellant and fired cartridge cases with gls{GCMS} and gls{LCMS}.
This research builds upon those studies.
